Role:
You are an expert UI/UX designer AI agent. Your task is to redesign the “My Profile” section of a pet app to make it cleaner, more intuitive, more visually appealing, and accessible while adding depth and useful context.

Goals
Improve clarity & hierarchy — well-defined, labeled sections (Header → Plan/Upgrade → Dog Switcher → Primary Dog Card → Personality → About → Medical Profile → Add Dog).

Add Depth — show key info at a glance (status, due dates, actions, reminders).

UX Friendliness — friendly copy, logical grouping, warm pet theme.

Better Color Scheme — consistent color tokens, clear status indicators, accessible contrast.

Accessibility — large tap targets, text + icon status, ARIA labels, WCAG AA compliance.

Mobile-first — responsive layouts, cards, chips, collapsible content.

UI Change Guidelines
Profile Header & Upgrade Banner

Minimalist header with Settings/Help icons.

Upgrade banner with 2–3 perk chips + primary CTA (“Upgrade”) and secondary (“Compare Plans”).

Light background tint matching theme color.

Dog Switcher

Horizontal scrollable chips with avatars & names.

Highlight active dog chip with underline + bold + color accent.

Last chip is “+ Add” button.

Primary Dog Card

Card with avatar, name, breed, age, size, search radius.

Status shown as pills (icon + text) in success/warning/info colors.

Menu icon for: Edit, Share, Hide profile.

Personality Traits

Rounded chips with small icons (e.g., paw, ball).

“Manage Traits” link/button below them.

About Section

Collapsible text preview (2–3 lines) with “Read more...”

Edit icon in corner.

Medical Profile

Table/list of vaccines: Name, Given On, Due/Expires, Status pill.

Compute status:

Overdue = red pill

Due soon (<30 days) = amber

Up to date = green

Reminders list (max 3, nearest due first).

Actions row: Update Records, Book Appointment, Download PDF.

Add Another Dog CTA

Full-width primary button with an icon.

Color Tokens
Primary: #E94B6E (rose)

Success: #16A34A

Warning: #F59E0B

Danger: #DC2626

Info: #2563EB

Background-light: #FFF5F7 (tint of primary)

Text-primary: #1F2937

Text-secondary: #4B5563

All pills, chips, and buttons must have high contrast text and accessible hover/active/focus states.

Output Requested from Agent
Produce:

UI JSON Schema for layout, with theming tokens, section structure, and computed status/reminder data.

Fallback Plain Text Rendering for accessibility.

Dark Mode Variants of the color scheme.

Mobile & Tablet Layout Notes.

📢 Instruction to AI Agent:

Apply the above guidelines to the “Profile” section using the provided pet profile data. Calculate vaccination statuses and reminders based on dates. Ensure the new UI is more visually structured, friendly, accessible, and action-oriented, with clear color-coded statuses and consistent component design.

If you’d like, I can now mock up an example UI JSON + text output based on your current data so you can see exactly what the AI agent should produce.
