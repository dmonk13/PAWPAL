Goals

Elevate look and usability while keeping existing features (messages, reactions, attachments, quick actions, proposals).

Prioritize readability, thumb reach, and low visual noise.

Layout

App bar: large avatar + name, small ‚Äúwith Owner - Online‚Äù. Right actions: voice, video, overflow. Subtle gradient underline for online state.

Conversation: soft, airy canvas; message groups with clear time separators; floating day chips.

Message bubbles

Receiver: white bubble, 1px #EAECF0 border, shadow xs; 14‚Äì16px font.

Reactions: compact, stacked below bubble; long-press to add.

Status ticks: tiny below-right of last message in a group.

Composer

Docked, rounded 20px field with placeholder ‚ÄúType a message‚Ä¶‚Äù.

Left: plus (expand sheet: photos, location, vet proposal, contact).

Right: mic (press-and-hold), send (paper plane), quick emoji.

Safe-area aware; grows to 4 lines; attachments preview above composer.

Quick actions row (above composer)

Chips: Share location, Schedule, Vet connect, Send profile. Horizontal scroll, haptics on tap.
